# Approximate Message-Passing Decoder 

This repo contains a `C++` implementation of the approimate message-decoder (AMP) on sparse superposition codes. It is baed on on these two papers [Replica Analysis and Approximate Message Passing Decoder for Superposition Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.8024)
